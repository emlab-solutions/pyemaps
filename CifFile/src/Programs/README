This directory contains small example programs showing some uses of PyCIFRW.  Of interest:

validate_cif.py    Validate against DDL1/DDL2 dictionaries.  For example:
     
  python validate_cif.py ../drel/testing/data/nacltest.cif -c -n cif_core.dic -u 2.3.1

will validate nacltest.cif using the information in cif_core.dic as distributed by the
IUCr ftp site. 


loop_example.py    Small program demonstrating how to pick particular columns from a loop

add_spoke.py       Add a hub-spoke structure to a CIF file by creating a 'hub' category and
                   keys in spoke categories that refer to the hub category.

output_asciidoc.py Convert a dictionary into an Ascii Doc file that can then be posted
                   on the web.
