This directory, apart from a few example programs, also contains
a simple web-server for validation.

To install, first install PyCifRW.

Following this: 

1.  install validate-process.py into your web server's
CGI directory and give it the appropriate permissions.   

2.  install cifv_server.html into your server's tree in an appropriate
place (this file is simply the form for entry of user data).

3.  Put all CIF dictionaries into directory /usr/local/lib/cif. For
correct naming, check the HTML source in cifv_server.html. 


Note that this web server has not been tested for almost a decade but
should work.
