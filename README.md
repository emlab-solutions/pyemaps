## Overview [`↩`](#contents) <a id="overview"></a>
__pyemaps__ package is a collection of python modules and libraries designed for transmission electron diffraction simulations and related crystallographic calculations. Main features include:

>**Crystal** : crystal data module, classes and methods loading crystal data from various sources, including diffraction patterns generation based on the crystal data and microscope and sample control parameters

>**DP** :  kinematic diffraction python class. It encapsulates diffraction pattern data generated by the Crystal class instance and diffraction pattern visualization methods such as plotting Kikuchi and HOLZ lines, and diffraction spots or disks and their indices. 

__pyemaps__ is based on the proprietary Fortran applications released as backend of [cloudEMAPS2.0](https://emaps.emlabsolutions.com). 

Future releases planned include:

>*Bloch* : dynamic Bloch wave simulation.

## Installation [`↩`](#contents) <a id="installation"></a>

```
(.venv) $ pip install pyemaps
 ```
where .venv is the python virtual environment

PYEMAPS_CRYSTALS environment variable is optional but setting it to a directory where all custom 
crystal data files are located provides central location for organizing crystal data.

```
    PYEMAPS_CRYSTALS=<local directory>
```

## Basic Usage [`↩`](#contents) <a id="basic-usage"></a>

```
from pyemaps import Crystal
from pyemaps import DP
```

## Getting Started [`↩`](#contents) <a id="getting-started"></a>

Run the following on command line, after above successful installation:

```
python sample.py
```

where sample.py is as follows:

```python
#import Crystal class from pyemaps as cryst
from pyemaps import Crystal as cryst
# create a crystal class instance and load it with builtin silican data
si = cryst.from_builtin('silicon')

# run diffraction on the crystal instance with all default controls
# parameters
si_dp = si.gen_diffPattern()
#plot and show the pattern just generated using pyemaps built-in plot function
si_dp.plot()
```

The alternative to run the above without creating sample.py:
```
python -m pyemaps --sample (-s)
```

The diffraction plot is generated with silicon crystal data built in the package:

```
crystal Silicon: dw = iso
cell 5.4307 5.4307 5.4307 90 90 90
atom si 0.125 0.125 0.125 0.4668 1.00
spg 227 2
```

and default electron microscope and sample control parameters:

```
zone axis: (0,0,1)
microscope mode: normal
microscope camera length : 1000 mm
microscope voltage: 200 kv
sample tilt: (0.0,0.0)
sample offset: (0.0,0.0)
spot size: 0.05 Å
```

To see all crystal names with builtin data, call:
```python
cryst.list_all_builtin_crystals()
```
where cryst is imported __pyemaps__ Crystal class

To use a crystal data not in built-in database in above format (as xtl format), replace the code in _sample.py_:
```python
si = cryst.from_builtin('silicon')
```
with:
```python
si = cryst.from_xtl(fn)
```
where _fn_ is a crystal data file name. __pyemaps__ searches for _fn_ if the full path is provided, otherwise, it will look it up in current working directory or in the directory set by PYEMAPS_CRYSTALS environment variable.

Checking __pyemaps__ version and displaying copyright information:
```
python -m pyemaps -c (--copyright)
python -m pyemaps -v (--version)
```

## Visualization [`↩`](#contents) <a id="visualization"></a>
In addition to Python's _matplotlib_ for displaying diffraction patterns generated by __pyemaps__ as shown above, DigitalMicrography (referred as DM here) is another option. The python script support in DM can realize the diffraction patterns from __pyemaps__ with its line and circle annotations as demonstrated below: 

```python
import numpy as np
import DigitalMicrograph as DM
from pyemaps import XMAX, YMAX
#----diffraction patterns generated by these bounds
#   [-XMAX, XMAX, -YMAX, YMAX]
#    screen size multiplier
mult = 4
#simple diffraction mode lookup
DIFF_MODE = ('Normal', 'CBED')
#------Diffraction modes-------
#       1 - normal
#       2 - CBED

    comp.SetResizable(False)

    dif_raw[:,:] = 255.0
    dm_dif_img = DM.CreateImage(dif_raw)
    dif_img = dm_dif_img.ShowImage()
    dif_img_disp = dm_dif_img.GetImageDisplay(0)
    
    if md <1 or md > 2:

        return 1

Other sample scripts designed for you to explore pyemaps are available in samples directory:
* __si_tilt_normal.py__: spot diffraction patterns generated with silicon crystal data, plotted with _matplotlib pyplot_ module. The code also shows how a list of diffraction patterns are generated and displayed as one of electron microscope and sample control - tilt in x direction changes.

* __si_tilt_cbed.py__: The same as above with the diffraction mode set to CBED.

* __pyplot_dm_si_diff.py__: DM python script which generate and plot diffraction pattern for silicon crystal using _matplotlib pyplot_ module

* __pyplot_dm_si_diff_color.py__: Similar to the above, the plot is done in color.
